                <p>Geographic Calculator is a powerful geodetic application with particular strength in survey, seismic, and energy exploration. In addition to single point, point database, and file conversion tools, this highly accurate transformation software includes many specialized tools such as Canadian DLS (Dominion Land Survey) Land Grid tools, Seismic Survey Conversion tools, Area of Use tools for guiding users, HTDP, Geoid Creation tools, and much more.</p>

                        <p>Geographic Calculator provides a single platform for highly accurate coordinate transformation of virtually any type of geospatial data and includes features such as:<br> 
                            <strong>Extensive support to databases,</strong> supporting a large number of formats such as Excel (.xls, xlsx), dBase (.dbf), Access (.mdb), ASCII (.csv, tsv), OBDC, and many more. The user can do geodesic calculations in more than 250 different file types. <br>
                            <strong>Conversion of point databases,</strong> which allows the user to convert and transform simple and organized coordinates, there is no limit on the size of the database of points and vectors that support manual transformations with scaling, translation and rotation parameters.</p>
                        <br>
                        <strong>The Seismic survey conversion </strong>, allows users to access, maintain, and convert SEG, SPS, and UKOOA formatted ASCII data faster and more efficiently. Quickly define custom reader rules to clean up improperly formatted data, convert multiple records types in the same file with a single pass and convert grid and geodetic record sets in a single pass <br>
                        <strong>3D coordinate support:</strong> The Geographic Calculator includes more vertical transformations and geoid definitions than any other GIS software. Support for vertical and horizontal transformation enables accurate 3D data processing particularly useful for LiDAR files, digital elevation models, and other terrain modeling. Pair the Calculator with Global Mapper and you can even make your own Geoid models.


                        <br>
                        <strong>Interactive georeferencing, </strong>selecting the control / reference points.  <br>
		<strong>selecting the control / reference points</strong> such as: GeoTIFF, MapInfo Table, ESRI World (TFW, WLD, JGW). <br>
		<strong>ESRI extension and CAD support, </strong>the user can define the coordinate transformations in the ArcMap by area of use, using the ESRI projection engine and the Blue Marble GeoCalc Engine, and in addition it has points of transfer of possible control points to split of ArcView, MapInfo, and AutoCAD de MircoStation.

                        <p>Is a sophisticated software which provides a suite of full wave modeling solutions to perform geophysical assessments and simulate the wave-field effects as a result of its propagation through Multi-parameter geological and geophysical numerical models, using the ray-tracing finite and difference methods, for the purpose of providing useful and high accuracy tools for seismic design surveys and quality control of processing workflows and 2D/3D seismic interpretation.<br>
                            Ray-tracing and finite difference methods are techniques for numerical modeling to accurately simulate the wave effects during the propagation of seismic wave-fields along multi-parameter geological models, where the model accuracy will be limited solely by the complex approximation to the wave equation.</p>

                        <p>Conventional seismic acquisition consists of detecting seismic waves through a line (2D seismic) or a grid (3D seismic) of receivers located near or over the surface of a geological area of interest. As a result, shotgathers are obtained for available sources and its corresponding geometry is observed, which compounds the acquisition data.
                            <br>
                            Similarly, the Tesseral's full wave modeling can be used at many steps of the seismic design survey for quality control, creating “synthetic shotgathers”, which can be analyzed similarly to real shotgathers. (Pre-Stack interpretation level.</p>

                        <p>In seismic data processing workflow, seismic data loading is performed (after some upgrades and improvements before processing procedures), and seismic images are generated to reveal geological boundaries and interfaces at different time and depths. In the processing workflow planning of seismic data, Tesseral’s full wave modeling helps you in the quality control process by assesing the proper processing sequences and parameters to apply to your companies seismic data.

                        <p>In order to analyze the generated shotgathers, Tesseral provides a visual analysis tool by ray tracing over target horizons and wave propagation movies, with the aim of identifying events, which correspond to conversión or converted waves reflected from a synthetic seismogram's target elements.</p>

                <p>By using Tesseral, users are able to create “synthetic shotgathers”, wave-field movies, incident wave time-fields, time sections, among others seismic images, AVO, etc., to perform analysis of arbitrary complexity models (high lateral velocity contrast, steep boundaries, compartmentalization, etc.), complex topography and near-surface conditions (sources and receiver’s elevation differences, traps, permafrost, low-velocity and variable thickness zones, refractions and surface wave-dynamics), thin layer models built from acoustic logs and density, visco-elastic properties, fluid saturated porous media models, among others. As a result, you can give recommendations on seismic design surveys, endorse seismic data processing workflows (conventional seismic, micro-seismic, VSP or high-frequency well logs simulation), AVO modeling for porous media, anisotropic, fluid saturated changing physical properties laterally and vertically, and verify the seismic interpretation accuracy for reflected discontinuities, and structural elements among others functionalities.
